# CapstoneMilestone1
What are you working on your project so far?
 I have currently created the welcome screen as well as the main menu for the project. I need to create a source file for the main menu and troubleshoot running the project and having the welcome screen appear before the main menu. I am thinking I should use the vi editor and have all the code in one terminal. This is my plan for the upcoming week, as well to complete the code for both the list and add options. I would like to have most of the coding completed by the second milestone if possible, and use the final week to clean up any errors, and customize the project to make it my own. For the time being I want a solid base that I know will work, and then branch out from there to make the project my own. 
 
 What are the current issues with your project?
 Although I have completed the code for the welcome screen and main menu, I have to figure out how to have them run together as I am using seperate Vi terminals for both. My plan for this week is to revisit old projects to refresh myself on how to have multiple terminals work together, or alternatively create the entire script under 1 vi editor if I have to do that method. Although this week was difficult to allocate time to this project, I am fortunate that I have a few days off of work this week and have time to really research the best method to create a running project. 
 
 Which part of the project do you plan on working on next?
  My plan for this upcoming week is to first figure out how to get the welcome screen and main menu to run together, and then code the list and add options. If I have time this week I would also like to code the search, delete, and exit options, and then use the final week to clean everything up.
